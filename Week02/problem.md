## Week 02: Binary Search Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement the Binary Search algorithm and analyze its performance.

### Problem Description
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Implement a function to perform binary search on a given sorted list or array.

### Requirements
- Input: A sorted list/array and a target value.
- Output: The index of the target value if found, or `-1` if not found.
- Implementations: At least two languages (e.g., Python and C).

### Example
#### Input
```
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Target: 7
```
#### Output
```
Index: 3
```
