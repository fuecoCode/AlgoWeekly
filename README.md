# AlgoWeekly

**Welcome to AlgoWeekly!** This repository documents my journey of weekly algorithmic coding practice in 2025. Each week, I will tackle a new problem or algorithm concept, implemented in multiple programming languages to deepen my understanding and improve versatility.

## Week 01: CRC32 Implementation
**Objective**: Implement a CRC32 checksum algorithm in at least two programming languages (e.g., Python and C).

### Problem Description
CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is an error-detecting code used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Implement a function to calculate the CRC32 checksum of a given input string.

### Requirements
- Input: A string or byte sequence.
- Output: The CRC32 checksum as a hexadecimal string.
- Implementations: At least two languages.

### Resources
- [Understanding CRC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
- [Example CRC32 Algorithm](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt)

## Week 02: Binary Search Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement the Binary Search algorithm and analyze its performance.

### Problem Description
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Implement a function to perform binary search on a given sorted list or array.

### Requirements
- Input: A sorted list/array and a target value.
- Output: The index of the target value if found, or `-1` if not found.
- Implementations: At least two languages (e.g., Python and C).

### Example
#### Input
```
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Target: 7
```
#### Output
```
Index: 3
```
