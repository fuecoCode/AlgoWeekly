## Week 01: CRC32 Implementation
**Objective**: Implement a CRC32 checksum algorithm in at least two programming languages (e.g., Python and C).

### Problem Description
CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is an error-detecting code used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Implement a function to calculate the CRC32 checksum of a given input string.

### Requirements
- Input: A string or byte sequence.
- Output: The CRC32 checksum as a hexadecimal string.
- Implementations: At least two languages.

### Resources
- [Understanding CRC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
- [Example CRC32 Algorithm](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt)

## Week 02: Binary Search Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement the Binary Search algorithm and analyze its performance.

### Problem Description
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Implement a function to perform binary search on a given sorted list or array.

### Requirements
- Input: A sorted list/array and a target value.
- Output: The index of the target value if found, or `-1` if not found.
- Implementations: At least two languages (e.g., Python and C).

### Example
#### Input
```
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Target: 7
```
#### Output
```
Index: 3
```

## Week 03: Merge Sort Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement the Merge Sort algorithm and analyze its complexity.

### Problem Description
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and merges them back together.

### Requirements
- Input: An unsorted list/array of integers.
- Output: A sorted list/array.
- Implementations: At least two languages.

### Resources

## Week 04: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
**Objective**: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

### Problem Description
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.

### Requirements
- Input: A weighted graph and a source node.
- Output: The shortest path distances from the source node to all other nodes.
- Implementations: At least two languages.

## Week 05: Knapsack Problem (0/1)
**Objective**: Solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

### Problem Description
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and value, and a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight. The goal is to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.

### Requirements
- Input: A list of items with weights and values, and a knapsack weight limit.
- Output: The maximum value that can be obtained.
- Implementations: At least two languages.

### Resources
